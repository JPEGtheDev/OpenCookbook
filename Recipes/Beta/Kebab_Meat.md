[Author: Jonathan Petz | JPEGtheDev]: #

This is a general purpose recipe for beef Kebab meat. This is a variation for simplicity's sake but the overall flavor is the same. Texture wise, it's completely different.

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds 88/12 Ground Beef
* 1 1/2 tsp. Paprika
* 1 1/2 tsp. Sumac
* 1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
* 1/4 tsp. Black Pepper
* 1/2 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes
* 1/4 tsp. Caraway Seed Powder
* 1 tsp. Fine Sea Salt
* 1 Yellow Onion
> Note: If you are looking for a fattier Kebab, go for a fattier mix of ground beef. 80/20 or 70/30 should work out depending on how you want to cook it up.
## Recommended Utensils:
* Cheese Grater
* Mixing Bowl

## Instructions
* Grate Onion and squeeze as much juice as you can out of it
* Combine all ingredients and mix thoroughly

> Note: If you want a more kebab like consistency, you need to blend the mixture in a food processor or meat grinder until you get a meat paste. If you are just looking for the kebab flavor without putting it on a skewer, you can skip this step.

> Note: If you are prepping this beforehand, it is recommended to leave the salt out of the mixture until about 30 minutes before you are ready to cook. Adding salt too early can lead to the meat being much denser, which may be the desired effect in some cases. Salt at your own risk.
