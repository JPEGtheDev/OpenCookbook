A simple recipe that has been perfected over decades of experimentation

## Ingredients

* 4000g "Party Wings"
* 1/2 cup paprika
* 3 tablespoons fine sea salt
* 3 tablespoons garlic powder
* 3 tablespoons onion powder
* 3 tablespoons cayenne pepper
* 4 tablespoons black pepper
* 680ml Franks Red Hot
* 680g water
* 1 cup Lemon juice

### Notes
* Need instructions on how to smoke, bake, and sous vide
* Amount of spices needs to be halved or amount of wings needs to be doubled.
* Years ago, I used a custom spice mix but I can't remember exactly what it was. I swapped over to Creole, but that has silicone dioxide and I want to dial in flavor I'm looking for. The current mix is close, but needs refinement.
* The exact amount of Franks Red Hot and water needs to be dialed in based on cooking method and how large of a container you marinate in.
