While not real Chicken Shawarma, it's kind of close to the real deal and is good in a pinch or when serving a large number of people.

## Ingredients
* 1300g boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 3/4 tsp. black pepper
* 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
* 3/4 tsp. onion powder
* 1 tsp. paprika
* 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom
* 1 1/2 tsp. fine sea salt
* 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
* 1/8 tsp. ground coriander
* 55g lemon juice
* 250g buttermilk 

## Recommended Utensils
* Tongs (Grilled)
* A bowl that is large enough to fit your ingredients
* Baking sheet (Baked)
* Wire rack (Baked)
* Temperature Probe / Thermometer

## Instructions

### Preparing the Chicken
* Combine spices in your bowl
* Add 1/2 of your buttermilk and all of your lemon juice, stir to combine
* Add your chicken thighs and mix
* Add enough buttermilk to make sure the chicken is covered and mix again
* Cover the bowl and let sit in the fridge for 8 - 72 Hours

> Note: The longer you leave your chicken in the buttermilk, the better it will taste. The more past due on the expiration date your buttermilk is, the tangier it will taste. While not advice from a medical professional, as long as it stays under a certain temperature and no other cultures are introduced, buttermilk should not go bad for a very long time and can be consumed as long as it is cooked in a dish. Please do not use buttermilk if it is moldy, off color, or no longer looks like buttermilk. Use your own judgement on this if it is past the expiration date.

### Grilled
* Preheat Grill to 425 Degrees Fahrenheit and make sure the grates are heated properly
* Place chicken skin side down on the grates and let cook for about 8 minutes
* Flip and continue to cook for about 8 more minutes
* Check the chicken and see if the temperature has reached at least 165 Degrees Fahrenheit. If it has not, place back on the grill and cook for another 3 minutes and check again. Repeat until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 Degrees Fahrenheit

### Baked
* Preheat Oven to 425 Degrees Fahrenheit
* Place chicken skin side down on a wire rack and place in the oven for about 8 minutes
* Flip chicken over and bake for another 8 minutes
* Check the chicken and see if the temperature has reached at least 165 Degrees Fahrenheit. If it has not, place back in the oven and bake for another 3 minutes and check again. Repeat until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 Degrees Fahrenheit


### Serving

Once your chicken has finished cooking, let it sit for about 8 minutes before slicing, so the juices cool off and stay in the chicken. Slice into cubes and serve.

### Freezing

You are able to flash freeze the individual cubes on a baking sheet for use in other dishes or as a standalone meal. Make sure that none of the pieces are touching each other and place uncovered in a freezer for approximately 3 hours, or until the pieces will no longer stick to each other. Remove from the tray and place in a storage container. You can store this recipe for up to 3 months in a standard sealed plastic freezer bag, even longer in a vacuum sealed bag.
