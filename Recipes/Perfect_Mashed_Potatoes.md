[Version 1.1]: #
[Author: Jonathan Petz | JPEGtheDev]: #

This is hands down one of the best mashed potato recipes out there. There is going to be a simple and "fancy" option on this recipe. This recipe also does not use butter, which may be weird for people who love mashed potatoes, but overall it comes out much better.


## Ingredients
* 2400g Yellow Potatoes
* 1 1/2 tsp. Black Pepper
* 2 tsp. Fine Sea Salt 
* 1 tbsp. Fine Sea Salt for the water
* 300g Heavy Whipping Cream
### Fancy Additions
* 2 Garlic Cloves
* 3 Sprigs of fresh thyme
* 1/2 Sprig of Fresh Rosemary

## Recommended Utensils
* Large Pot
* Potato masher or handheld mixer
* Strainer / Colander

### Fancy Additions
* Sauce Pan
* Fine Mesh Strainer / Sieve


## Instructions

* Wash Potatoes
  > Note: You can peel the potatoes before the next step, but it depends on personal preference.
* Cut Potatoes into cubes
* Add potatoes to your pot and cover with water. You want to have enough water so that your potatoes have about an inch of water over them.
* Salt the water
* Bring the water to a boil and reduce heat so that the water is simmering.
* cover the pot with a lid and cook for about 15 - 25 minutes or until the potatoes fall apart when stuck with a fork.
> Note: if you are going for the fancy version of this recipe, you may want to start a bit earlier to make sure you have everything ready
* Strain potatoes and return to the pan

### Fancy
* In a sauce pan, add in your Heavy Cream, Thyme and Rosemary
* Crush your garlic and add to the pan
* place your pan on a burner and set to a medium-low heat for a few minutes to infuse the flavor
* strain and set aside. Use this as your heavy cream and proceed with the regular instructions
> Note: if your potatoes are ready, just strain the pan directly into the potatoes, no need to set it aside

### Regular
* Pour the remaining Salt, Pepper, and Heavy Whipping Cream into the pot and mash until you have the consistency you are looking for.


### Freezing

You can portion out and freeze these in any which way you want. One of the better methods is to portion in either 1 cup or 1/2 cup portions and freeze individually. A silicone muffin tin can work extremely well in this case and can produce 1/2 cup portions easily.
